    <h3><strong>A) About The Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>This theme is designed to be easy to use for either static HTML pages, or to
    convert for a content management system (CMS). The design is broken down to allow
    each section to be separated into a self-contained content block. These blocks are marked with comment tags to make finding them easier:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;!-- / End of previous block --&gt;

&lt;div id="TheIdOfTheContainer" &gt;
&lt;some HTML content /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- / End of TheIdOfTheContainer --&gt;                   
</pre>

    <h4>Layouts - <a href="../html/page.html">page.html</a></h4>

    <p>There are examples of the different layouts and content configurations in the
    sample pages. Detailed information can be found on the "Layout" page (<a href=
    "../html/page.html">page.html</a>) included in the sample files.</p>

    <p>Theme used responsive center-aligned layout by default.</p>

    <h4>Text - <a href="../html/page.html">page.html</a></h4>

    <p>Text formatting details are also available in the sample files. For this
    information view the page (<a href="../html/page.html">page.html</a>) included in the sample files. This contains example code and sample outputs of all the common HTML tags used for content editing.</p>

    <h4>Fonts</h4>

    <p>The logo in the included files with the main content uses "PT Serif" font. These are free fonts available online on <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Montez">Google Web Fonts</a>. Font fallbacks:</p>
    <p><code> 'PT Serif', 'Georgia', serif </code></p>

    <p>Social icons use custom font generated on <a href="http://fontello.com/">fontello.com</a>. The font files you may find (and replace) inside the <strong>/3rd/font</strong> folder. Display these icons by using <strong>'social'</strong> class on parent. Each icon relative to the symbol in the table below (e.g. f = Facebook, h = GitHub):
    <img src="chars.png">
    </p>

    <a name="html" id="html"></a>

    <h3><strong>B) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>This theme is a fixed-max-width design with pre-configured styles for creating layouts with three or many columns.</p>

    <p>The default content area (#main) is easy to find. Look for the HTML with the text "main".</p>

    <p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements in one of these columns, you would do the following:</p>
    <pre>
#main a {
        color: [color];
}      
</pre>

    <p>If you find that your new style is not overriding, it is most likely because of a specificity problem. Scroll down in your CSS file and make sure that there isn't a similar style that has more weight. I.E.</p>
    <pre>
#main a {
        color: [color];
}            
</pre>

    <p>To ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p>

    <p>The HTML code is indented to make it easier to edit. There are also comment markers as a guides to find the beginning and end of major sections.</p>

    <p>You may use the included sample files as templates for your own layouts. Be sure to backup a file before editing it, or create a copy and work from it.</p>

    <h3>C) CSS Files and Structure - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

    <p>There are several CSS files included with this theme. These files are all located in the root folder. Within 'img' folder there are sub-folder 'css' containing style image sources.</p>

    <p><strong>style.css</strong> - This is the foundation of all the site design. It
    controls all the layout and design structure of the theme. The skin files may extend style.css to apply custom styles. Once you have the skin CSS file for you custom skin, be sure to add a link to it in all your HTML files in the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of each page. You may also wish to edit this file if you choose to customize the main menu.<br>
    <br>
    Your link should look something like this:<br>
    <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style-dark.css"&gt;</code></p>

    <h4>More about skinning this design</h4>

    <p>You can find more information about the CSS styles and skinning of the design by
    viewing the sample pages.</p>

      <p>To add your own email address to the form, open the file
      "<strong>contact.php</strong>" and at the very top of the file replace
      "<strong>noreply@noreply.no</strong>" with your own email address. Be sure not to
      delete the quotes, semi-colon or other code when making this change.</p>

      <p><code>$your_email = "<strong>noreply@noreply.no</strong>";</code></p>

      <p><strong>Problems Sending Emails</strong></p>

      <p>If you experience trouble sending emails you should verify the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure the address entered in "<strong>contact.php</strong>" is
        correct.</li>

        <li>Verify that PHP is installed on the server your site is running on.</li>

        <li>If necessary, contact your hosting provider to ensure they do not need to
        activate something.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Pages with Contact Forms</h4>

    <p>Check that <strong>script.js</strong> included in the &lt;head&gt; tag of any page
    with the contact form.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
